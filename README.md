Repo for my Electronic Time Capsule / Enviromental Monitor Logger

as seen on https://hackaday.io/project/160740-low-power-environment-monitor-logger
but I also keep it going on my personal site alnwlsn.ax.lt/projectrepository/index.php/Electronic_Time_Capsule


2022-03-20
I created a new board revision - As usual, one of these is scheduled to go into this year's time capsule, and I'm out of units from the first batch I made. So, I'm taking the oppertunity to make a new PCB design. I made it a bit larger, since there's no reason to make the board smaller than the battery pack, and I also added a bunch of extra footprints in case I want to try out or can't find certain sensors. Could have picked a better year than 2022 honestly.
