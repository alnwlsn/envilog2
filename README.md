Repo for my Electronic Time Capsule / Enviromental Monitor Logger

as seen on https://hackaday.io/project/160740-low-power-environment-monitor-logger
but I also keep it going on my personal site alnwlsn.ax.lt/projectrepository/index.php/Electronic_Time_Capsule


2022-03-20
I created a new board revision - As usual, one of these is scheduled to go into this year's time capsule, and I'm out of units from the first batch I made. So, I'm taking the oppertunity to make a new PCB design. I made it a bit larger, since there's no reason to make the board smaller than the battery pack, and I also added a bunch of extra footprints in case I want to try out or can't find certain sensors. Could have picked a better year than 2022 honestly.



# 2023 recovery
The 5 years is up, and I was finally able to retrive the first unit (which is of this design). It lasted about 3.5 years, and I made a matplotlib script (/sheetplot) to make a nice graph of the data. Of course, I'll eventually need to overlay data from other units, but I won't recover the first of those until next year, so for now I don't need to do anything.
